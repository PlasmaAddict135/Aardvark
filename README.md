## Getting Started:
To get started with your first output do: `output('hello world!\n')`. There you go, you've officially ran your first program! Take note of the `\n` it is very important that that is included otherwise you'll break it (for now). If you (like me) get tired quickly of writing `\n` you can go ahead and use `#include anr` press enter, and then run `output('hello world!')`. See! works without the `\n`. We'll talk more about `#include` later, but for now thats all you need to know.
